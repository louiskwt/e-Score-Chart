# E-score-keeper

A score keeper app that allows me to facilitate a small game in class

## Description

The UI is created using CSS flexbox, and it utilises event listener as well as CSS animation to make it dynamic and interactive. It's built with bootstrap 4

## Next Step
In the future, I'd like to turn it into a mobile app and add more functionality to it
